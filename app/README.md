## Module Structure
Each module typically contains:

- Services (*.service.ts)
- DTOs (dto/*.dto.ts)
- Entities (entities/*.entity.ts)
- Module definition (*.module.ts)

## Best Practices
- Each module follows SOLID principles
- Implements dependency injection
- Uses TypeORM for database operations
- Follows NestJS architectural patterns
- Implements proper error handling and validation

## Getting Started
1. All business logic is organized in respective modules
2. Each module can be tested independently
3. Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces
4. Follow proper dependency injection patterns

## Development Guidelines
- Keep modules focused and single-responsibility
- Use proper decorators for dependency injection
- Implement proper validation using DTOs
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
